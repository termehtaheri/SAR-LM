abstract: >
  Large language models (LLMs) have advanced in text and vision, but their reasoning
  on audio remains limited. SAR-LM introduces a symbolic audio reasoning pipeline that
  converts audio into structured, human-readable features across speech, sound events,
  and music. These symbolic inputs support both reasoning and transparent error analysis,
  enabling clear tracing of model failures. Across three benchmarks—MMAU, MMAR, and
  OmniBench—SAR-LM achieves competitive accuracy while prioritizing interpretability.
